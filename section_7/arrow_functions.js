/*ES6 introduced a new and shorter way of declaring an anonymous
function, which is known as Arrow Functions. In an Arrow function, 
everything remains the same, except here we donâ€™t need the 
function keyword also.*/

var greet = () => {
    console.log("Hello,I am arrow function!");
}

greet();

//if we have only a single statement in the function body,we can
//even remove the curly braces.

var greet1 = () => console.log("Hello,I am greet1 function!");

greet1();
